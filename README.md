# Credit Card Customer Clustering

A machine learning project about credit card customer clustering to create relevant segmentation. This project explore the datasets and then process it to be used for modeling. The model used in this projects are K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture with varying hyperparameter for each model. This project use inertial elbow, silhouette score, and silhouette visualization to determine the best number of cluster.

In the end K-means have the best silhouette score compared to the other algorithm, and visually has the best clustering. Thus the end result were 3 cluster/segment with cluster 0 consist of low spender with low balance, while cluster 1 has medium balance but high spending with installment, and cluster 2 has the highest balance and pay in advance.
